# Dutch Auction Implementation Using Solidity
A Dutch auction is a type of auction in which the auctioneer starts with an extremely high price. The auctioneer progressively lowers the price until a bid is placed. Once the bid is placed, the auction is over.

This is a simple smart contract implementation of a dutch auction using Solidity. The code was written in <a href='https://remix.ethereum.org/'>Remix - Ethereum IDE</a> and tested on the Sepolia ETH testnet.
